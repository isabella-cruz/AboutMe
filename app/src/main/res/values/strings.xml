    <string name="bio_description">Hello, this is Isabella and I am an Intern here in the Mobile
Platform squad.
\n\nI always was curious about how things happen(If you agree, I always will ask you about
everything).
\n\nI started my technological career doing a basic course about hardware and after this, I fell in
love with the computational world. My first opportunity with this world was working in a support
team for 2 years and after this time, I finally could work as an auxiliary analyst supporting one
ERP for more 2 years. But, I always want more, and I decided to do my first graduation: Analyze and
Development of Systems - It is the place where I found myself. So, I am working hard to learn
everything about the Androids world, and I am really happy coding, learning (I love to learn, read,
do courses), it really makes me happy and I cant describe what feelings I feel when I am building
something by myself.
\n\nMy biggest dream, it is build something that everyone, in the whole world can use, something
that changes to better the life who is using it. And, in the future, I want too help people who want
to learn how to program.
\n\nAbout my hobbies? I like to study in my free time, read fiction books, go to the gym (do weight
training with a lot of weight), drink wine (my prefer is merlot grape), watch a lot of TV series
and movies, get out with my boyfriend and my family to dinner, travel to meet new places, listen to
great music (techno please) and walk with my little dog, Mel.
\n\nI hope to build amazing things here at iFood that have a positive impact on peoples lives.</string>
